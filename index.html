                The bot stores publicly available information such as: game username, Discord user id. It also stores information about the server where the bot is located (ONLY IF SOME CHANGES ARE MADE TO THE BOT OR CERTAIN FUNCTIONS ARE USED, FOR EXAMPLE CHANGING PREFIXES OR USING THE TRACKING FUNCTION).<br>
                <br>
                This information is used for the sole purpose of obtaining the required game data, sending messages to the selected channels or keeping track of the selected prefix. The information is stored in a database managed by us, which is protected by 2-Auth key access and only we have access to it.<br>
                <br>
                Your information is stored indefinitely in our database as it is necessary for commands that you can use without any mandatory use of parameters, such as getting your own game profile, tracking your moves in order to show the best ones, etc.<br>
                <br>
                If you want to remove your information such as your Discord username or nickname from the database, you can do so by joining the Discord server.

                We do not store information about the messages sent to the different servers where the bot is located. As we said before, the only information stored is related to the game, the Discord user ID or the server used only for the purpose of providing the different features that the bot contains.<br>
                <br>
                We make use of the content of the messages to perform certain actions such as: Existence or not of content related to the other bot, existence or not of links related to the game, existence or not of parameters related to the latter or to some attachment related to the game and existence or not of bot command.<br>
                <br>
                If you own a server and do not want this information to be tracked, you can reduce the permissions of the bot in different channels, leaving it in one related to the game so that the bot performs the checks only in that channel.<br>
                If you are a server user, you have the right not to send any message in the bot related channels.<br>
